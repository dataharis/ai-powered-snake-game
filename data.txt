Hey everyone! 👋 Have you ever wondered if AI can play the classic Snake game? 🐍 Well, I built an AI-powered Snake game using Deep Q-Learning, where the AI learns from its own mistakes and improves over time! 🚀"

🎯 (0:10 - 0:30) - How It Works
"The AI observes the game environment, decides its next move, and gets rewarded for good actions—like eating food—or penalized for bad ones, like hitting a wall. Over thousands of games, it learns the best strategy to maximize its score! 📈"

🛠 (0:30 - 0:45) - Technology Used
"I used Python, Pygame for the game, and Deep Q-Learning for training. The AI starts off making random moves, but with experience replay and neural networks, it becomes a pro at Snake! 🎮"

🚀 (0:45 - 1:00) - Results & Conclusion
"At first, it struggles, but after training, it outperforms human players! This project showcases the power of Reinforcement Learning in game AI. Want to learn more? Check out the full project! Thanks for watching! 🙌🔥"
